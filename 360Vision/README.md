# 360Vision

## Project Description
360Vision is a project that shows how to seamlessly stitch images into a 360 degrees panoramic image. This project explores advanced image stitching and projection methods to create seamless and cohesive panoramas from multiple images. Our goal is to simplify the process of creating 360Â° images and provide insights into the best practices for panoramic photography and image processing.

## Installation
Download the 360Vision folder and stitching.ipynb. Upload your own images into the 'images' folder.

Install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All dependencies are also declared in the .ipynb files. 
## Run the Notebook

Download the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb File

To run the tutorial an your machine and experiment e.g. with your own images put your images in the `images` directory and run the notebook using

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage
1. Download the 360Vision folder
2. Upload into Google Colab
3. Upload your own images into 'images' folder
4. Run the code
5. After generating the image, you can upload and view your 360 panoramic image at https://renderstuff.com/tools/360-panorama-web-viewer/

## Methodology

We utilized OpenCV's Stitcher library for efficent image stitching
