# 360Vision

## Project Description
360Vision is a project that shows how to seamlessly stitch images into a 360 degrees panoramic image. This project explores advanced image stitching and projection methods to create seamless and cohesive panoramas from multiple images. Our goal is to simplify the process of creating 360Â° images and provide insights into the best practices for panoramic photography and image processing.

## Installation

Install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Notebook

To run the tutorial an your machine and experiment e.g. with your own images put your images in the `images` directory and run the notebook using

```

## Usage
1. Install dependencies
2. Download the 360Vision folder
3. Upload into Google Colab
4. Upload your own images into 'images' folder
5. Run the code
6. After generating the image, you can upload and view your 360 panoramic image at https://renderstuff.com/tools/360-panorama-web-viewer/

## Methodology

We utilized OpenCV's Stitcher library for efficent image stitching
